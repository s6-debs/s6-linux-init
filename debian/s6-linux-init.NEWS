s6-linux-init (1.0.6.1-1) buster; urgency=medium

  * It is recommended, though not necessary, to recreate any run-image
    directories created with s6-linux-init-maker after installing this
    update. Old images will continue to boot, however signals sent to init may
    not be handled correctly.
