Description: A tool to automate the creation of suitable stage 1 init binaries for s6-based Linux systems
 s6-linux-init is a set of minimalistic tools to create a s6-based init
 system, including a /sbin/init binary, on a Linux kernel. The resulting
 architecture follows the Unix philosophy as closely as possible, and is
 fully dedicated to the s6 way of managing a system. Nevertheless, the
 architecture is fully compliant with various empirical and historical
 specifications.
